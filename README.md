[00:06.54] BLACKPINK in your area
[00:17.54] 
[00:11.51] 보란 듯이 무너졌어
[00:15.48] 바닥을 뚫고 저 지하까지
[00:19.17] 옷 끝자락 잡겠다고
[00:22.78] 저 높이 두 손을 뻗어 봐도
[00:30.28] 
[00:26.78] 다시 캄캄한 이곳에 light up the sky
[00:30.54] 네 두 눈을 보며, I'll kiss you goodbye
[00:34.51] 실컷 비웃어라 꼴 좋으니까
[00:37.64] 이제 너희 하나, 둘, 셋
[00:44.64] 
[00:40.50] Ho-how you like that?
[00:44.72] You gon' like that, that-that-that-that, that-that-that-that
[00:48.63] How you like that? (Bada-bing, bada-boom-boom-boom)
[00:52.04] How you like that, that-that-that-that, that-that-that-that?
[01:22.04] 
[00:56.34] Now look at you, now look at me, look at you, now look at me
[01:00.82] Look at you, now look at me, how you like that?
[01:03.67] Now look at you, now look at me, look at you, now look at me
[01:08.18] Look at you, now look at me, how you like that?
[01:31.68] 
[01:11.47] Your girl need it all and that's a hunnid
[01:13.39] 백 개 중에 백 내 몫을 원해
[01:15.17] Karma come and get some
[01:15.95] 딱하지만 어쩔 수 없잖아
[01:18.39] What's up? I'm right back
[01:20.15] 방아쇠를 cock back
[01:22.02] Plain Jane get hijacked, don't like me?
[01:23.52] Then tell me how you like that, like that
[01:44.02] 
[01:26.18] 더 캄캄한 이곳에 shine like the stars
[01:29.87] 그 미소를 띠며, I'll kiss you goodbye
[01:33.74] 실컷 비웃어라 꼴 좋으니까
[01:36.86] 이제 너희 하나, 둘, 셋
[01:43.86] 
[01:39.56] Ho-how you like that?
[01:43.65] You gon' like that, that-that-that-that, that-that-that-that
[01:47.60] How you like that? (Bada-bing, bada-boom-boom-boom)
[01:51.07] How you like that, that-that-that-that, that-that-that-that?
[02:21.07] 
[01:55.42] Now look at you, now look at me, look at you, now look at me
[01:59.98] Look at you, now look at me, how you like that?
[02:02.63] Now look at you, now look at me, look at you, now look at me
[02:06.88] Look at you, now look at me, how you like that?
[02:30.38] 
[02:10.52] 날개 잃은 채로 추락했던 날
[02:14.45] 어두운 나날 속에 갇혀 있던 날
[02:18.12] 그때쯤에 넌 날 끝내야 했어
[02:21.21] Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
[02:43.71] 
[02:28.07] Yeah-eh-eh-eh
[02:31.57] Bring out your boss, bitch
[02:35.46] Yeah-eh-eh-eh
[02:39.12] BLACKPINK!
[02:44.12] 
[02:39.87] 뚜뚜뚜뚜두두, 뚜뚜뚜뚜두두 (how you like that?)
[02:43.32] 뚜뚜뚜뚜두두, 뚜뚜뚜뚜두두두 (you gon' like that)
[02:47.29] 뚜뚜뚜뚜두두, 뚜뚜뚜뚜두두 (how you like that?)
